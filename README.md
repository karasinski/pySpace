# pySpace

## Concept
pySpace is a poorly named game created using pygame. I'm using it to learn more about object oriented Python and as an attempt to create a complete, multi-platform game.

## Controls
The player can rotate the ship left and right with the left and right keys, and apply forward thrust with the up key. The down key will turn the player around to face in the opposite direction of their velocity (useful for slowing down). The spacebar fires the ship's weapon.

## TODO
+ Import sprite sheet (multiple ships)
+ A camera to follow the player around as they move
+ Other game objects (planets, other ships, asteroids, stars, other background imagery)
+ An overworld map
+ Ability to jump between different systems
+ Upgrade weapon (allow multiple weapons, ability to switch between them, missles)
+ Ship to ship combat 
+ Basic AI (attack player, conduct random trade missions)
+ Missions
+ Game menus
